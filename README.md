# Introduction

React Frontend with NestJS Backend as separate services.

NestJS runs locally on Port 3001
React runs locally on Port 3000

There are obviously lots of things that can be added or need to be refactored.

<li>
    Unit Tests for both Front and Backend
</li>
<li>
    Show events/tickets display more concisely
</li>
<li>
    Error handling for promise rejections
</li>
<li>
    Missing barcode type validation. Possibly regex needed :expressionless:	
</li>
